As I am not the most eloquent when it comes to counselling, I ask you to help lord Mohg in this endeavor. Yours truly, Varré.\"\n\nA contractor once received this letter in his version of the Lands Between through a series of butterfly effects, and although he decided not to pursue it we believe it might serve as an entertaining quest.\n\nThe mission is relatively simple, you are to successfully infiltrate Mohgwyn Palace as a noble and help counsel Mohg himself in the creation of his dynasty of blood, separate of the Golden Order. It should have enough legitimacy to subvert the Greater Will but also be functionable enough to not immediately fall apart if you decide to leave. This includes making sure his and Miquellas relationship is not seen in a negative light, while also making sure that the empyrean consents.\n\nThese objectives can be achieved in a number of ways and you may take as much time as you need, but we expect the Moghwyn Dynasty to come out on top in the end with your direct involvement.",

However, the Dungeon's intrigue deepens significantly as one ventures further into its uncharted territories.\n\nIn this altered version of the canon, a century prior to the established canon, a meteorite carrying a peculiar crystal descended into Lolog Lake near the fishing city of Melen. Submerged for several years, the crystal, resembling a pink gem containing what appears to be a miniature black hole, resonated with the Dungeon's energy. Surprisingly, it traversed the earth, evading the Leviathan Seal in the lake, and found its way into the Dungeon. Monsters, slightly empowered by its presence, transported it to the deepest floors, where it now rests on an altar guarded by mutated creatures.\n\nRecently, the crystal has exhibited unusual behavior and started accumulating power following the defeat of the Zeus and Hera Familias. To prevent catastrophic consequences, a mission has been proposed: reach the Dungeon's abyss, destroy the crystal with an Ultimate Attack, causing the black hole to dissipate. The urgency arises from the fact that the crystal, if left unchecked, will unleash its power, reviving Behemoth and Leviathan while amplifying the One-Eyed Black Dragon's strength by 1.5 and healing its previous injuries. If the Dragon was previously defeated, it will be resurrected at 75% of its original power alongside the other beasts.\n\nAlternatively, adventurers can choose a riskier yet potentially rewarding path. By touching the crystal, one can extend their consciousness to it and expedite the process. The revived Beasts will be weaker and the crystal's durability lowered. In doing so, the crystal can be retained and used as a reservoir of power, capable of reviving individuals up to Tier 10. However, exceeding this limit will result in the crystal's explosive demise, unable to contain the overwhelming power required. \nThe fate of the world hangs in the balance, with 450 days remaining before the crystal unleashes its destructive potential.\n\nIf you opt for the Drop-In Origin, you will find yourself automatically materializing a week prior to Bell's encounter with Hestia. You'll be garbed in medieval peasant attire and equipped with a backpack containing spare clothes, a map, personal hygiene items (toothbrush, toothpaste, etc.) and multiple sets of underwear. Positioned one mile away from Orario, you'll have sufficient Valis to gain entry into the city and sustain yourself for a week, covering expenses for accommodation and meals, should you choose to lodge at Mamma Mia's inn.\n\nIn the case of selecting the Extra Origin, your circumstances will be similar to the Drop-In but instead of appearing out of thin air, your origins will trace back to a random village. This change arises after the unfortunate demise of your family, prompting you to embark on the path of becoming an adventurer. You will carry a modest dagger and don a medieval peasant attire beneath a worn leather chest piece, along with any additional items that this supplementary character has brought along.\n\nIf you chose the Substitute option, your arrival is more straightforward. You seamlessly take the place of your chosen character within the narrative. \nThe circumstances surrounding these insertions are open to your discretion, e.g. you want a single use razor for your beard."

But it’s really quite simple: the Contractors are the Servants, not the Masters!\n\nYou and six other Contractors will be summoned to a random world to act as Servants for seven characters native to that world. This world's Danger Rating will be no higher than your Tier, but it can be anywhere below it. It will not count for the purposes of Exit Stage Left or Calming Up. Everyone’s knowledge of the world will be the same. While it is highly recommended you have some experience before taking this mission, it isn’t required.\n\nWho your Master is will be based on your personality and compatibility, and Universal Calibration will be applied free of charge so your Master reflects your preferences. All things considered, it SHOULD be relatively easy to get a love confession from them, though we make no guarantees. A free Template Stacking I and II will be applied to you for a Servant Class determined by your personality and abilities; unless you purchase it yourself you do not keep this TS after the mission. You will have your own unique Parameters, Skills, and Noble Phantasms. If you already have Template Stacking for a canon Servant, then you will be summoned into one of that Servant’s canon Classes unless a different one is more eligible overall.\n\nYour enemies will be roughly equal to you in power, skill, and experience, though you are all capped at Tier 10. For example, all enemy Servants will have the same Tier and Origin type as you. If you used Power Swap, your opponents will also have Power Swapped to a character of the same Tier. If you have a Heritage, the others will have one too. Lastly, if you Substituted, Possessed, or TSed a canon Nasuverse character, then so will your opponents. This is to make sure everyone is on even ground when it comes to True Name discernment.\n\nUpon winning or losing, you will be sent back to wherever you were when you accepted this mission, with any physical, mental, and spiritual injuries sustained during the War healed as if nothing ever happened. Any Companions or Familiars acquired will be teleported back with you.\n\nIf any rules are broken, then a veteran Contractor will be summoned as an independent Ruler Class Servant. They will also have seven of their retinue members with them, each one with a different Servant Class. Their Lures and Command Seals will work on you without hindrance, but they can't Capture you excluding the exceptions below.\n\nNow, with all the boring legalities out of the way, let the Company Holy Grail War begin!",

Simply speaking, their origin and biology makes it hard to get a proper grasp on their powers, but we believe that if you defeat the targets using the power of ahegao and mind breaking pleasure, their resistance should be temporarily gone and we can learn a lot from them.That said, you can first beat them up if you want.

Like, so cliche and just lame. That's been in so many works of fiction. Guy/girl saves other guy/girl's life, automatically becomes the pairing. They even have that cheesy chocolate interaction.\n\nBut listen to me here, our boy Genji deserves someone better than that cold blonde mad doctor. He deserves someone who understands his family issues and looks cool in cybernetic armor too.

You are bound to the credo of: 'The Dragon of Domination makes his mates submit, rules over his followers, conquers his enemies, and crushes those that would usurp him. How he does this is irrelevant: Power, Violence, Manipulation, Seduction, or Love. The only forbidden path is Cruelty.' The Client is very demanding, but also very generous supplying a healthy signing bonus despite the intensity he is demanding. \n\nPrimary Goals:\nBe Recognized as a High Class Being\nCreate a Harem (Minimum of 5) of satisfied Women who are not purchased Waifus.\nDefeat at least 5 High Class Beings (Kokabiel, Loki, Diodora, Sairaorg or the such) in solo combat. Yes fighting them after they have fought others is allowed as long as your fight is alone. \nDefeat either the White Dragon Emperor or the current Prison Dragon Wielder in single combat. \nCreate a Dragon Faction\n\nStart:\nStarting Universe: Variant Highschool DxD World. Danger Rating 10\nIntensity: Legacy Intensity, Me and my Girlfriends mode, with the modifiers of Limited World Travel, Intact Weaknesses, Live In Interesting times, Non-Exponential Template Stacking Cost, and Limitless Power Source.\nOrigin: Must take Substitute Issei Hyoudou (Tier 8) with Dragon Template. Issei will have just the Boosted Gear but it will be fully unlocked. \nBonus of one IMG Ticket to be spent on Ancestral Diversity. \nMust take the Dragon Heritage: Dragon Heart (Fire) and Dragon Scales (Fire), Dragon Aura, Dragon Thrall, Dragon Blood, Dragon Hoard, Dragon Cabin, Dragon Bifurcation, Dragon Break, and Double Dragon (Element of Choice). \nMust take the Transhuman Heritage: First Augmentation, Network Glamour Manipulation, Corporal Transcendence Engine, and Evolutionary Engine Array. Must purchase prerequisites as well\nPatron: The Embodiment of Domination. Grants a 50% rebate on all Bindings and Lures and a 1 Tier Reduction in purchasing Slightly Used Waifus. Contractor cannot purchase fresh Clones, sell Waifus/Husbandos, or be Submissive to their Retinue. Captures can only be attained only from Domination be it soft or hard. Mental and Physical Torture of Retinue and Followers is not allowed. \nStarting Date is Beginning of the Rias Gremorys Final year at Kuoh Academy. \n"

Lovecraft has two main themes: Cosmic horror, and the incomprehensible and unimaginably powerful Outer Gods that embody that horror.\n\nTherein lies the problem: This is not good for business. Contractors have an annoying tendency to not want to die, but also desire the power possessed by the Waifus of Lovecraft's Mythos. While this means we can jack up the prices for them significantly, getting more is always a nightmare, since no one wants to do the dirty work.\nThat's where you come in. We're experimenting with a new format of Godly Waifu hunting to increase recruitment rates, and you're our test subject. You signed up, didn't you? If you haven't, well... It's a bit late for regrets.\n\nWe have dedicated a local omniverse to 'Cute True Form' tests, of which we've decided you will be sent to participate in. Other tests are occurring, of course, you're just not liable to survive the 'sexually voracious' or 'heavy porn physics' ones. Mortality rates have shifted us towards less overt Capture-encouragement method experiments. Maybe if you do paticularly well we'll let you take a peek at the others.\n\nThe main change we're testing with you is that, instead of 'tenticled, planet sized ball of flesh' being the natural form of Lovecraftian Deities, 'Cute Girl' has instead become the default. They can still assume their cosmic horror forms, it is simply not their most comfortable or natural. All Deities are guaranteed to possess both forms, though personal usage of either is dependant heavily on the paticular Waifu and their quirks.\n\nFor Participating in this Test, take 150 credits for Chargen or normal use(credits for this mission are given upon selection rather then completion). It's enough for a few defenses, though we recommend far more. Or not, seeing how their psyche has changed with respect to insolent or dangerous humans, now that they're more naturally empathetic with humans, will be similarly valuable test data. Though you likely won't survive the process... Just because they're cute doesn't mean they're any less dangerous. We hope this isn't news to you.\n\n\nAs an aside, while we don't demand you capture even a decent amount of T10+ waifus, at least 1 is required to judge for this test, so you may not leave the universe until this task is completed. If you're regretful, maybe don't sign untitled waivers. In the Company, it's typically a bad idea(though of course we thank you for participating anyway).\nPlease, don't feel obligated to completely capture every Waifu in this universe, we're looking for eagerness data rather then capture data, here.",

We are here to talk about business.\n\nNot too long ago, a bunch of Nascent Gods got the bright idea of holding a couple of interdimensional tournaments to earn themselves a bit of clout among their older, more experimented peers. Each of these tournaments will represent a different Concept, something to distinguish it from your average multiversal contest.\n\nIn this particular case, the Concepts in question are \"Fantasy\", \"Battle Harem\", and \"Royal Battle\".\n\nThey have Shangai'd from their home worlds the protagonists of many stories featuring the first two concepts, along with the most prominent members of their harems, and have been set to fight in groups against their fellow kidnapping victims from other works in a different dimension, all for the for the not-so-small prize of an omnipotent, reality-altering Wish if they come out as the victors of this game. \n\nA one-week-long affair filled with relentless fights against the competition, all set in a sea of limitless trees and crumbling buildings, devoid of any life other than the occasional small animal. \n\nSounds like a fun event, right? But there is a small, tiny little problem with all of this. You see, these upstarts wannabe ROB's?\n\nThey are on our shit list.\n\nThese fuckers have been talking trash about us for quite some time already. Usually, this kind of behavior wouldn't affect us in the slightest. I mean, what can they even do against us? Oppose us? Please. If we feel merciful, they would only become persona non grata in most civilized parts of the Omniverse. If they catch us in a bad mood, though... Well, we leave that to your imagination, Contractor.\n\nBut you see, these guys somehow managed to get in the good graces of a lot of influential people, all of them being more than willing to listen to their idiotic prattle about us. Thanks to them, we have lost a significant number of business partners and investors, enough of them to hurt our pockets.\n\nThe objective of your mission is pretty straightforward, Contractor. Make them pay. Due to their carelessness, we have discovered the method they plan to use to secure their participants. We are going to hijack it and register you as the Main Character of an obscure Light Novel, along with four retinue members of your choosing.\n\nYou're going in, roleplay as an average Light Novel protagonist with his haremettes for a while, and once the night of the second day falls... That's when the fun begins.\n\nYou are to go on a capture spree, while we run interference to prevent the assholes running this event from stopping you. You are to bind every Contestant you come across during this event until all of the remaining participants belong to your retinue. Once you have achieved that, we'll beam you out of there\n\nGive them hell, Contractor. Make them regret messing with us.",

Instead of going to the vanilla, boring world of Pokémon, we instead are going to send you to its better and far superior variant, the wonderful World of Moemon!\n\nThis world is inhabited by creatures called Moemon. Powerful, fearsome, dangerous, but above all that, cute-looking beings that aren't that much different from their regular Pokemon counterparts, despite what their human-like appearance might suggest, inability to say anything more than their species' name included.\n\nFor some people, Moemon are pets. Others use them for fights. As for ourselves... We're going to sell them as glorified sex pets, of course! That's like, our whole schtick, Contractor!\n\nYour mission is pretty simple. We're dropping you in a region of your choosing, and then you'll have to live up to the old motto of 'Gotta Catch 'em all!'. You are to capture every single Moemon featured in the regional MoeDex, legendaries included, of course.\n\nBeyond that, it's up to you what you wish to do for the duration of the mission. Collect the eight badges, take the title of Regional Champion of the Moemon League for yourself, or beat up the regional Evil Team, we don't particularly care as long as you complete the main objective.\n\nUnfortunately, we couldn't procure the help of any of the Regional Professors, so too bad for you, it seems like you'll have to make do without a MoeDex or one of the usual three Starters on this occasion. Still, we're not without heart, so to compensate you for the lack of local support, you will be given a modified basic MoeBall with a guaranteed 100% Capture Rate so you can capture your first partner by yourself, Regional Starters be damned.\n\nWe have to warn you though that it will only work as a functional Master Ball for around 60 minutes after your insertion, and it WILL lose the increased Catch Rate if you even try to capture a Moemon with another MoeBall, so we recommend you use it right away if you can.\n\nOther than that? Go nuts. This timeline is pretty much a carbon copy of that of the games. Make of that what you will.\n\nContractor! Your very own Moemon legend is about to unfold! A world of dreams and adventures with Moemon awaits! Let's go!",

Rapists, killers, sociopaths, psychopaths, villains, genociders. It doesn't matter how wrong or fucked up it might be. If you can name it, chances are that we have a whole division worth of it among our ranks.\n\nYet, despite all of our collective sins, there is one thing that surprisingly few of us can stand. We are talking of course, of bad parenting.\n\n...Yeah, we might have a complex with this, we admit it. How the hell do you think so many of us ended up working here in the first place? By growing up in a healthy and loving family unit? Don't make us laugh, Contractor.\n\n...Oh! The mission. Right. I nearly forgot about that.\n\nDo you remember Sephiroth? You know, white hair, long-ass Katana, black coat, ominous theme, the main antagonist from his game, that Sephiroth? Well, some of our employees believe that things would have played vastly differently if someone raised him properly instead of putting him through the whole lab rat experience, and as the good Patrons we are, we decided to test if their theory is true.\n\nWe were at first thinking of tweaking things a little on a variant of the setting to see what would happen in that scenario, but... Truth be told, Contractor? Out of every possible candidate, not even a single one of them meets the criteria for what it means to be a good parent under our standards.\n\nLucrecia? She used Sephiroth as a test subject while he was still in her womb. Vincent? He's currently occupied being comatic and roleplaying as a vampire. Hojo? ...Well, you've already seen how things played canon.\n\nSo, seeing how everyone who could have realistically taken care of baby Sephiroth doesn't have the mindset to be a good parent to him, we have decided instead to take care of this matter with our own hands. Or rather, your hands.\n\nWe'll drop you near the facility in which ShinRa is currently experimenting on Sephiroth, a month or so after his birth. You are to break in there, extract the infant Sephiroth, and leave without a trace.\n\nBut your mission doesn't end up there, Contractor. We're barely at the beginning of this ordeal.\n\nThat child you just rescued? You are to Adopt it and raise him as part of your family until he is of age. He will grow under your tender care, enjoying a happy and carefree childhood, living his youth to its fullest, all under the warm and loving gaze of a family that loves him. And after everything is said and done? He is to return to his homeworld, fully willing to challenge the World and become the Hero he was supposed to be.\n\nHe is to be aware of his original fate. Aware of what he was supposed to be, and he is to strive to become better than that. And if once he is of age he wants to join our Company as a Contractor, following the steps of his parent and continuing the familiar business? Even better for us.",

They will unlock for use on Kali once you have had sex with her at least once. But you will need a bit more work to get them fully usable. They are called “Profane Acupressure” and “Heretical Acupuncture”. The first lets you increase someone’s physical sensitivity to pleasure up to 300 times for 24 hours using pressure points.

Conquering Worlds while being limited to Tier 2 and with no help of their retinue, capturing High Tier Targets without using Lures and having to recur to just stealth, that kind of thing. But the one that concerns us at the moment? Their love for Speedrunning Grand Missions and Long Settings while being under the most ridiculous limitations imaginable, all for the sake of bragging rights and the feeling of accomplishment.\n\nOne of these many Speedrunners Contractors took upon himself the Task of completing the First Arc of Fate Grand Order in the least time possible, managing to put his name in the Top 10 Rankings by filling his Exit Stage Left progress bar in under 3 minutes after being inserted in Singularity F. Now, we won't bother you with the details, but the guy managed to defeat Goetia by beating him up to death with a common balloon, and what is important for this mission, by stealing all of the Grails sustaining the Singularities and throwing them out of that World, to wander endlessly in the Void.\n\nSo, what is the issue then? Well, it seems that these golden little trinkets managed to find its way into another Setting. Particularly, one known for its weird metaphysical rules and some bullshit about the Heart. The thing is... well... we were not the first to find them. Either the Locals or the Heartless did it, and either by sheer bad luck or with an actual intention of doing it, they managed to activate them. Short things short? There are Servants now running across the setting, for both good and ill.\n\nNow, we could have retrieved the Grails ourselves or something, but since you guys seem to be so desperate for a bit of amusement, we decided to make it a Mission instead.\n\nGo forth, travel across the Worlds, retrieve the Grails, beat or capture the summoned Servants, and correct all of the... Huh?... The Grail is doing what!?\n\n...Oh well. More Credits for you, I guess.",

Appears to be the result of poor energy regulation of the Miraculous she was using, the Peacock of Emotion. Should be pretty simple to handle, just drain whatever excess is in her system and give her a little boost to help her recover\n\nThis leads us directly to the second issue, the Peacock is broken. Should be simple to handle again. Just directly reestablish the link between the spirit and the jewelry\n\n But her main goal is the acquisition of the Black Cat and Ladybug Miraculous in order to make a wish. \n\nThis is a lot to ask for normally, but she's made it worth our while.\n\nShe's not only giving the Company herself (through you as a Contractor) she's also giving up the Peacock and Butterfly Miraculous, spirits bound to them included.\n\nWith the data from them, we'll be able to develop plenty of Aethermorphs and Outsiders.\n\nNow, some warnings before you go in.\n\nWe've noticed some...instability in the time stream, Paradox Defense is recommended.\n\nAlso, because of how the Wizard created the Miraculous, Company based teleportation won't work on them unless you hold them on your person and have activated them. \n\nThey also effectively insulate their holders from being Captured by a Company Binding.\n\nAnd one last thing to keep in mind is that Miraculous holders are considered metaphysically distinct from their transformed counterparts.

As Naruto dies, you will take full control of his body while cracking the seal that holds all your power, unfortunately this will cause that you only had control over one of your tails at the start, causing you to go in a berserker like state when you try to use more tails without enough training.",

As such, the Company needs them to stop being a problem, which is where the Patrons come in.\nThese Lost Companion Collectives, for reasons yet unknown, almost always consist near-exclusively of Companions that are of interest to one or more of the Patrons, so they gladly sponsor these Clean-Up Missions and Contractors for their own benefit.\nThis time the problem has come to a Variant Kingdom Hearts, one where just about every reality you can imagine exists within, either as a World that can be visited, or through variant versions of their populace spread throughout.\nThe Collective that has settled in this reality consists primarily of abused former Companions, tending to be either physically, emotionally, or psychologically scarred (or some combination thereof) former heroes or neutrals, and who are all T8-10 in power. As best as can be determined, there are 20 members of this group, but there may be more, if you can find them, and they are scattered throughout the Worlds. Naturally, their status has caught the eye of the Archangel of Benevolence.\nYour Mission, should you accept it, is to neutralise all these rogue former Companions, either by Capturing them, or by otherwise binding them to some form of unbreakable agreement to cease further interference with Company matters. The Angel will not tolerate Killing any of these rogues unless you have no other choice at the time, so unnecessary killings will result in failure.\n\nOh, and the Angel's decided that a perfect fit for this mission already exists in the World, so you'll have to either already be her, or to become her.

Total societal breakdown and governmental collapses have occurred. With the fall of the civilized world, many women around the world have risen to the occasion becoming Peacekeepers, Heroes, and Just Rulers. While a lot more often than not has fallen to becoming Bandits, Warlords, and Dictators.\n\nThe women of the dc universe both major and minor have formed new factions, kingdoms and groups. A new Justice League has formed led out of the Hall of Justice by Wonder Women dedicated to peacekeeping and protecting civilians within their territory rather than fighting crime. Meanwhile out of the Titans Tower a group of former justice members has formed the Justice Lords led by Powergirl trying to maintain order in Jump City although with a more authoritarian touch. \n\nWhile many female villains have done the same, becoming powerful Warlords throughout the world. Lena Luthor has reformed the Legion of Doom to take advantage of the situation. Blüdhaven has completely fallen to hostile and deadly Plant Life. Gotham City has become the largest lawless haven in the world for slavers, gangs, murders, thieves, prostitutes, assassins, mercenaries, warlords, constantly vying for control of the city. Talia al Ghul and Lady Shiva have taken control of the League of Shadows, and have taken over parts of Western Asia. \n\nThe Supernatural side of the world has also been affected, now no longer hiding themselves from the world. Themyscira is under threat by literally everyone including the Olympians. Mera is left to rule Atlantis by herself and preparing to wage war, individuals such as Maxima, Trigon, Highfather, Mongul, Sinestro, Brainiac, Darkseid and Others have taken notice of earth's weakened state and are preparing to take advantage. And of course, there's what Amanda Waller is up to. \n\nTo say things, look bleak in an understatement, this is where you come in Contractor. Your goals are simple: Convert at least 50% of the female population to Tier 7 dragons and stabilize the male population for future generations. Forge a Dragon Army capable of repelling Justice League level threats and maintain order on earth for at least 15 years.",

Now, we at the Company strongly believe in keeping your word and one of our clients has decided to sponsor a little mission to make Kuroko’s dream come true. Your job this time will be to make sure that Misaka Mikoto, Shirai Kuroko, Saten Ruiko and Uiharu Kazari all spend a lot of time and have fun at a nude beach.\n\nWhen you move to the beach, there will be three potential complications available. Pick at least one randomly. You may take more for extra reward. The Contractor isn’t aware of this but will have to deal with the problem to guarantee a successful mission end.\n\n1. A mad scientist has released a mutagen that has started to transform the sealife into dangerous and lewd creatures. You will have to deal with an escalating amount of lewd monster attacks until the problem is dealt with.\n2. A magician who wants to weaken Academy City is setting up a spell to drain the intelligence of the beach’s visitors and steadily transform them into sex hungry bimbos. Any defenses you have will protect you but not the targets.\n3. A group of high-level students and faculty members from Tokiwadai are moving in to close the beach under the declaration that it is sinful and inappropriate for students. You will need to stop them from doing so and perhaps change their opinion on such matters."

This will only apply to pre-stamped targets and not targets stamped post mission completion. If you buy any other bindings before all of the ramp up periods are complete, the incomplete stamps will disappear and you will need to use your new binding instead.\n\nOptionally, you may also purchase a tier three, 15 credit, version of Memorabilia to have as many, or as few, of your beloved pets, living or dead, follow you into the New World as either a Felyne (Palico) or Canyne (Palamute) and serve as your official Palico(s)/Palamute(s) for this journey.

But there is something I believe to be equally as infinite, if far more rare. \nWillpower.\n\nI like to think that with enough grit, determination, and willingness to get back up, any challenge can be overcome. So why not test it then within the realm of Lordran(And Boletaria for good measure).\nYou will be Dropped-in to the setting at the original starting areas and with the goal of making your way to the end.

Any purchases from the Company are still valid, but you will have no access to any baring Pocket space while actively on the duration of this mission. If any purchases have made you some form of beyond human existence, the body you will do this mission with will be a clone of who you once were, with your mind forced to operate it as it's soul vehicle until done.\n\nYou are free to gather, use and store any gear you pick up on the journey, as well as have full access to the leveling/strengthening systems of the respective worlds, which can further allow use of the casting systems of each world. Upon the completion of the cycle however, all gear and progress is lost when beginning the next.(Any gear gathered will immediately transfer to your pocket space upon you finishing that cycle, it will just be unavailable until the mission is over.)\n\nAnd just as a reminder of what you're fighting for, upon each cycles completion, you are allowed a full 48 hours in either your own purchased home, or within replica of your original world if you did not purchase a home, with access to all your Companions & other purchases. Use this time to rest, prepare, inform those who follow your of your trials(Regardless of the amount of time your take in each cycle, only a week will pass by in the realm they are in) and enjoy yourself. At the end of the 48 hours though, you will return to your mission in the next subsequent cycle. ",

It was Us that helped Bran the Builder build and enchant the Wall. It was Us that drained the Great Other of most of Its strength at great cost of our own. Now the Great Other is rising again, stronger than before with humanity almost magicless and unprepared. And that would be that, a planet smothered in Night and Terror. Until a clerk digging through files found a second contract from Azor Ahai. He added a clause to our deal that we are obligated to obey. It seems that Azor Ahai wrote that should the Great Other not be defeated and that the White Walker are to return, We The Company would return as well to snuff out this cold.

Your primary purpose is to ensure Taylor Hebert finds success and happiness in life. Good luck.\nYou are acting as Taylor's power. This has a number of different effects — you cannot directly countermand her instructions, although you can creatively interpret them. Additionally, you can't simply solve things in the background without her knowing, and you aren't allowed to intentionally escalate past Taylor. Until she willingly has you kill, maim, or use one of your Bindings or Master abilities you can't go around using them on your own.\nTaylor is immune to all forms of control, including Bindings and the memetic addictive effects of Lures. She is not immune to social manipulation, gaslighting, grooming, or any other more mundane methods of control if you're subtle and skilled enough to pierce her bubble of stubborn bullheadedness. She cannot be captured by any means until the mission is completed.\nDespite this, Taylor counts as a member of your retinue for all other purposes, including Talents, Heritage perks, Defenses, and other effects. You can freely purchase Template Stacking for her, although you can't Power Swap her to anyone else — you're her power, after all. Also, as you're acting as her power, she is of course without her canonical insect control ability.\nThe Mission does not count as complete until Taylor is truly and fully satisfied with her life. In most world lines, this will involve being a successful hero, but other good ends do exist for her depending on your nature and the choices you both make.\nMission Rewards:\nDue to the mission's duration and nature locking you to Taylor for an extended period, you do get some bonuses.\nFor the duration of your stay in Earth Bet, you will benefit from all defenses at a level of your choice. This is opt-in and can be fine-tuned to your personal desires.\nEvery time Taylor wins a cape fight, you receive a small sum of credits. This is subject to diminishing returns based on how significant the win is, so you can't simply grind the same street-level gangs for infinite budget.\nIf Taylor becomes part of a Cape Team, this rewards credits depending on the number, strength, and coherence of the team. Having a smaller, closer team is worth more than a massive loose collection. Social links matter. Taylor being or becoming the leader, officially or not, increases this value.\nYou cannot buy waifus for the duration of the mission.",

This Mission itself is simple, if a bit tedious in Execution. He wants Trophies of Original Waifus. Confused, let me explain. You know how some people have mounted heads of animals? Think like that only it includes the torso and some of the forearms and thighs, attached via bondage gear. Oh, and alive if empty in mind. Simple commands can still be followed. Anyway, to do this you will be given three syringes and a special knife with the same protections as the Company Stamp. You will inject one of the syringe's contents in the cervical spine of a willing or unconscious (sleeping or knocked out) waifu, waiting 60 seconds (tracked by your Smart Device) and then using the knife to sever the Waifus limbs. Once done they will be transported to either your Home or your Demiplane Home for you to place on a Trophy Plaque. The Syringes all scrub the waifus mind and two turn all internal organs (aside from those directly connected to the orifices) into standard flesh, the last just ensure the organs work without needing fed and watered. The Black Syringe also sterilises the womb, ensuring no children from any 'play' times. The Red Syringe instead makes it so the womb is fertile for a week and permanently lactate. The Blue Syringe just numbs the mind and allows you to get their organs if you wish. Of course, the syringes have infinite uses so you can experiment at your whim, although without Warranty Plan, you will lose any of your retinue as functioning members. As recompense, you can turn any leftovers (severed limbs at minimum) into useful items.",

However, the contractor severely underestimated the strategic brilliance of the Overlord and was taken out of the equation embarrassingly quickly - the idiot didn't even try to prepare a resurrection method in what was obviously a highly dangerous world with a DR rating of 9.\n\nIn any case, he managed to screw up even in death, a multiversal artifact in his possession going haywire and shattering the dimensional barriers. And then the undead overlord Ainz Ooal Gown somehow managed to make the situation even worse. \n\nAs soon as he realized the multiversal nature of the fracture, he tampered with it in an attempt to summon the rest of his friends and guild-mates to the New World with him. Obviously, things did not go as planned and now locations and organizations recognized as 'Guilds' from across the multiverse find themselves displaced into the New World.",

But as final bosses, they are of course destined to be defeated by a plucky band of heroes. Clearly, we are in need of a new breed of final bosses.\n\nYour mission, should you accept it, is to conquer the main continents of the Fire Emblem games: Archanea, Valentia, Jugdral, Elibe, Magvel, Tellius, Ylisse, Hoshido/Nohr/Valla, and Fodlan. You may choose to proceed in whatever order you'd like. For the continent of Magvel, you may choose between the Binding Blade timeline or the Blazing Blade timeline, or to conquer one then leap to a fresh World of the other. For the continent of Fodlan, you may choose between Three Houses or Three Hopes. Any future mainline games or spin-offs may be included at will.\n\nConquering a continent requires the subjugation of every country on it. This includes capturing or killing their leaders, pacifying the citizens, and ensuring no uprisings can occur. It does not necessarily require capturing the entire cast, although you may do so if you'd like.\n\nTo keep with the theme, this mission is only available to Contractors with the Dragon Heritage, including those with Ancestral Diversity. If a Contractor uses the Symbiote binding, units must be dragon-themed. And finally, to make it somewhat fair for the natives, weapons with increased potency against dragons similarly affect the Contractor, his retinue, and any Symbiote units, ignoring any Company Defenses.",

Apparently in this setting, there are some very specific and limited set of abilities known as \"Authorities\" (Yes, we know the name sounds pretty generic, but it's not our fault this time) that, as far as we have seen, grants their user a special supernatural skill of their own, not unlike a Semblance in which it seems to be unique in nature, based on one of the \"sevens deadly sins\".\n\nSo if for example, you get the Authority of, say, Greed, chances are that you will get an ability heavily associated with the sin, like the ability to steal conceptual shit or mark things as yours pretty much like a second Binding, but less effective. There is a downside, though, because it SEEMS there is a correlation between the Authority's power and the mental sanity of the User. The more unhinged you are, the stronger your Authority will be.\n\nYour task is pretty simple, regardless of how easy I made it sound. You go in, capture all of the Archbishops of Sin plus anyone that holds an Authority by the moment of your insertion, and get out. And if you can capture anyone who seems to know something about the inner workings of a Witch Gene, it will be greatly appreciated.\n\nWe have to warn you though, this world is far more dangerous than how it might seem at a first glance. Don't get too cocky because their Tier is lower than what you would usually consider a threat to your life. Ram (HALF of a Tier 5 Waifu) was able to fight Roswaal L. Mathers to a standstill, Emilia might be holding an Authority of her own while having the Apocalypse itself as her familiar, Reinhard seems to embody the concept of \"Unfairness\" and Subaru might become your worst nightmare if you fuck things up.

Because of all the corruption, his empire is falling apart, but he is unaware of it because his \"trusted\" advisers are feeding him lies. The people he tries to protect either fear or detest him because, despite his desire to be a good ruler, his own inexperience prevented him from being one. The single person that backs him is ineffective and does nothing to address the problem. And by the time he realized that instead of bringing his people peace and prosperity, he had only brought them suffering, it was too late, and he was sentenced to death. A sad ending for the boy, who will most likely be remembered as history’s worst emperor. How pitiful it really demonstrates how unfair life can be. So what if we decide to alter his fate?

We have managed to limit the damage but the problem is one that must be dealt with extreme prejudice before it escalates into an actual crisis. \nThe traitor is unfortunately very crafty, and while that is a trait that the company values very much in our contractors, it is currently acting to our detriment as said traitor is deceptively proficient in escaping danger. \nThe company has managed to quarantine the Traitor to a series of worlds ranging the Danger Ratings of 8 and 9, and have even disabled all his travel options. However, he proved himself annoying once again by deploying corrupted versions of the Elden Ring whose reality warping functions were rigged to caused multiple realities to collapse into each other, and form permanently open rifts between them through which anyone can freely travel. \n\nThe worlds you'll be sent to will most likely be undergoing one form of apocalyptic scenario or the other due to all the multiversal incursions, breaches and displacements whittling down the local society and economy, You must navigate delicate sociopolitical landscapes and explore dangerous war-zones to locate and retrieve the corrupted Elden Rings responsible for the local nexus. \nThe local factions will aid or hinder you depending on which world you are on and how you approach them, so some preparation before establishing contact is necessary. Especially so since they might have valuable intel on the threats you may encounter on said world. \n\nAfter all, it is nearly impossible to predict what entity will cross over next, and some especially dangerous threats may have already passed through undetected due to all the distortions on site making any attempt at a comprehensive scan unreliable.  \n\nThe Greater WIll, along with other such powerful multiversal Outer Gods are interested in the situation and are watching. \nAnd while the Greater Will in particular doesn't mind others taking its damaged toys, it will very much get annoyed if you make too much of a ruckus while doing so. It will most likely retaliate by deploying 'stars' the likes of Astel and the Elden Beast to deal with you and resolve the situation on its own.

Rather, to make things more interesting we want you to take the role of the “enemy” of adventurers everywhere, though not necessarily the murderous sort as the local Dungeon does. Thus for this mission, your goal isn’t to conquer the Dungeon, it's to subvert it to much more fun and lewd purposes. Really, we just want to see someone going and making a full on hentai dungeon if we are honest. We can somewhat tilt things in your favor by making the base Dungeon lewder, just don’t expect it to be less dangerous. Note that the Dungeon will be actively trying to oust you, but if you are careful you can steadily subsume it while gathering support for yourself.",

You do not have to be a master (or even a magic user) to accomplish this mission.\n\nPossessing TS Magic User or any stronger logic based caster (such as TS D&D Wizard) will enable you to summon a servant. Your servant is not automatically bound, but you do gain the usual three command seals. You cannot pick your servant, but if you can find an artifact associated with a servant you can shift the summoning towards that servant.

Rozalin, the supposed daughter, searches for her “father” together with young Adell who wishes to defeat him for allegedly turning everyone on Veldime into demons. This is where you come into things.

At best she can hope to live a few more years beyond the war, dying young but at least with bittersweet happiness on her lips. At other times she sacrifices her life for the sake of her adopted sibling. Worst case she ends up dying painfully, heart ripped out after her protector got slaughtered trying to defend her. We of the Company are curious to see if a sponsored guardian of ours could do better, which is where you come in. For this mission you will replace Berserker as Illya's Servant and his job to protect her from danger. Your victory conditions are for her to survive the Grail War, have her health problems fixed and deal with her adopted sibling.",

I sort of started in a lower level slice of life setting and stuff and randomly ended up in Touhou by the power of RNG. Tried to keep a low profile of course. Fortunately I got faerie feast and stuff, so I managed to get a few of the local fairies to like me and stuff. A few careless confessions later and I was sure everything was going great.\n\nThen I got my hands on Rumia and things went to hell. I thought I needed someone who can do more than shoot magic bullets down the line, so I decided to give her a little power up. Saber Alter seemed fitting… I mean the aesthetics should fit with her darkness powers and all that. I thought that would be perfect.\n\nExcept it turns out the whole thing with Ex-Rumia wasn’t just a meme. Send help, she almost killed me when that damn ribbon came off. I think the power has driven her mad, but at least she hasn’t killed me. That said, she kinda chained me to the kitchen and is currently trying to burn down Gensokyo to stop anyone from stealing me, together with some other waifus of mine she has scared into submission. A few other girls got away and I think they may be trying to get help from the locals… I think she may have also affected some of them with the grail mud corruption from the Alter power-up... Please, if you get me out of here, you can have Rumia, hell feel free to catch any free waifu in this place. I just want to get out of this alive and whole.",

One after another, they are killed and their deaths increase as Medusa’s hunger rises, growing to enjoy the slaughter of these men that would steal away her beloved sisters. Soon she will turn into a beast, soon the tale will come to an end and then a hero will come to slay the monster, never knowing of the true tragedy that had taken place here. Your purpose is simple, to avert this tragedy entirely. For this purpose, you will be inserted on mainland Greece and then need to make your way to the shapeless isle and stop the tragedy in its make.",

Cute and varied depending on the cat species in question. Overall they possess notably lower average intelligence than humans, increased natural affection and feline instincts among other things. Combine that with an increased sexual openness and they make for popular pets to the point where most households soon have their very own catgirl. But alas, as the years pass, the fad starts fading and demand for catgirls quickly decreases. Food costs, lack of care and irresponsible breeding soon lead to a wave of stray cats all over the world. Some abandoned by humans, some raised in 'the wild' so to speak. Given time, organizations will form to help these adorable creatures but as is, there is little support for the homeless hybrids. This is where you come in. Your job for this mission is to take in as many catgirls as possible and supply them with loving homes and a job.
