It essentially grants anyone endowed with the Falna boosted Stats if they were a Level higher than they currently were.\n\nA related item that must be protected for this Mission is an item that, while dark in nature and horribly heretical, can trap the Renard's Youjutsu and Soul and spread it to others by a certain sacrificial ritual, also known as the Killing Stone.\n\nHowever, because of the actions of a frustrated Aisha Belka, the plan was significantly delayed and later stopped by the Hestia and Freya Familia, both for differing reasons.\n\nYou will have two routes you can be brought in, before Aisha destroys the first Killing Stone the Ishtar Familia originally had or sometime before the day of Ishtar Familia's Canon disbanding.\n\nIt's simple, allow the Killing Stone Ritual to transpire successfully, trapping the soul of Sanjouno Haruhime into the Killing Stone on the Night of the Full Moon before breaking it to be used for the Ishtar Familia in their war with the Freya Familia.\n\nGood luck!",
