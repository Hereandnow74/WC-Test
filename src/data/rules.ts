First, pick a starting world. Depending on that world’s danger rating, measured on a scale from 1 to 10, you’ll be assigned a number of credits with which to make the rest of your purchases. Danger ratings are weighed based on the power of the typical combatants, the average danger level to ordinary people living in that world, and especially the actual cost of what might be needed to survive in that world. Additionally, as you may choose when you enter a world, doing so during an active apocalyptic scenario may raise a world’s rating by one or even two tiers. Specific worlds and their ratings are listed in the second page of the spreadsheet.
Next, modify your starting budget by your intensity multiplier. The base multiplier is 1x. This multiplier is modified using the co-operative and PvP options found in the CYOA Modes section. All changes to the intensity multiplier are additive.
Now that you know your budget, pick an Origin, one Binding-type control, and as many of the Lure-type controls, Perks, and waifus or husbandos as you can afford. The company’s Waifus and Husbandos are all clones manufactured on demand, except where noted. They come packaged with their iconic outfits, personal equipment, and familiars or treasured pets, when appropriate. The largest equipment normally allowed are motorcycles, but there are some rare exceptions. For your own ease of accounting, you may only purchase one copy of any distinct entry at a time. They are sorted into eleven tiers, each of which has a different cost. See the table on the first page of the spreadsheet for details. The waifu lists properly begin on page 3 of the spreadsheet. Third-party waifu and husbando lists are also allowed and may be found elsewhere.
