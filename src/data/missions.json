Cute and varied depending on the cat species in question. Overall they possess notably lower average intelligence than humans, increased natural affection and feline instincts among other things. Combine that with an increased sexual openness and they make for popular pets to the point where most households soon have their very own catgirl. But alas, as the years pass, the fad starts fading and demand for catgirls quickly decreases. Food costs, lack of care and irresponsible breeding soon lead to a wave of stray cats all over the world. Some abandoned by humans, some raised in 'the wild' so to speak. Given time, organizations will form to help these adorable creatures but as is, there is little support for the homeless hybrids.

Unfortunately, one of our more eccentric agents passed through this word a short time ago and left it in somewhat of a… sorry state. To make it simple, the contractor in question is a big fan of giant robot shows, but has little interest in anything outside that. So the good news is that Gendo Ikari and most of SEELE are dead as they tried to get in his way. The bad news is that all the Evangelions have been stolen, including the Lance of Longinus since he saw it as a “signature weapon”. Lilith left for parts unknown after a short rampage throughout the city that fortunately didn’t kill too many civilians. This has left the Geofront unguarded, with a piece of Adam that the Angels would desire and the mother of earth’s life unaccounted for. Thus, during this mission you must empower the local main characters in whatever ways you can so that they can defeat the Angels. Without giant robots though, we don’t want to attract our eccentric agent to that particular world again.",

You must hijack the project and make sure the clones of Misaka Mikoto are repurposed for the sex toy industry.<br>The main goal will be to sell Misaka clones to the population for the purpose of sexual relief, impregnation and the production of pornography and the like.

The Testament machine should be used to upload sexual skills and knowledge otherwise needed for whatever other role the Misaka may have.<br>If you fail to make a profit within the desired time frame or your project gets shut down by something, a canon version of Misaka Mikoto and Accelerator will both be informed of your actions and you will have to deal with them on your own.

Unfortunately, in recent history, Enel the wielder of the Goru Goru no mi usurped the previous ruler Gan Fall and imposed his tyrannical rule on the land as the new 'God' of Skypeia.  This cannot be allowed to stand. Remove this fool from power and become the true 'God' of Skypiea. To do so you must become the ruler of the three inhabited regions and have no other claimants to the region."
