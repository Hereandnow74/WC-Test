So, one of our new contractors got stupidly drunk and shoved an Hogyoku, yes the wishing granting orb, inside the rear end of the mythic moon chasing wolf Hatii, which is now wreaking havoc across several dimensions. So, we need a contractor to capture the wolf, recover the Hogyoku and retrieve the wolf to its rightful dimension. Also please do try to kill the contractor who fucked-up.",

But as final bosses, they are of course destined to be defeated by a plucky band of heroes. Clearly, we are in need of a new breed of final bosses.\n\nYour mission, should you accept it, is to conquer the main continents of the Fire Emblem games: Archanea, Valentia, Jugdral, Elibe, Magvel, Tellius, Ylisse, Hoshido/Nohr/Valla, and Fodlan. You may choose to proceed in whatever order you'd like. For the continent of Magvel, you may choose between the Binding Blade timeline or the Blazing Blade timeline, or to conquer one then leap to a fresh World of the other. For the continent of Fodlan, you may choose between Three Houses or Three Hopes. Any future mainline games or spin-offs may be included at will.\n\nConquering a continent requires the subjugation of every country on it. This includes capturing or killing their leaders, pacifying the citizens, and ensuring no uprisings can occur. It does not necessarily require capturing the entire cast, although you may do so if you'd like.\n\nTo keep with the theme, this mission is only available to Contractors with the Dragon Heritage, including those with Ancestral Diversity. If a Contractor uses the Symbiote binding, units must be dragon-themed. And finally, to make it somewhat fair for the natives, weapons with increased potency against dragons similarly affect the Contractor, his retinue, and any Symbiote units, ignoring any Company Defenses.",

While there are a number of ways to do so he's found that the simplest and easiest way to have someone removed from the Academy roster is for them to not attend classes for seven days without permission or extenuating circumstances after which they are expelled. Due to not wanting any issues to reflect on the Schnee family he is paying for his daughters entire team to be removed from Beacon Academy.\n\nMission Parameters:\nEnsure that team RWBY doesn't attend classes at Beacon Academy for seven days in a row within the time limit by any means the contractor is capable of.

Apparently in this setting, there are some very specific and limited set of abilities known as \"Authorities\" (Yes, we know the name sounds pretty generic, but it's not our fault this time) that, as far as we have seen, grants their user a special supernatural skill of their own, not unlike a Semblance in which it seems to be unique in nature, based on one of the \"sevens deadly sins\".\n\nSo if for example, you get the Authority of, say, Greed, chances are that you will get an ability heavily associated with the sin, like the ability to steal conceptual shit or mark things as yours pretty much like a second Binding, but less effective. There is a downside, though, because it SEEMS there is a correlation between the Authority's power and the mental sanity of the User. The more unhinged you are, the stronger your Authority will be.\n\nYour task is pretty simple, regardless of how easy I made it sound. You go in, capture all of the Archbishops of Sin plus anyone that holds an Authority by the moment of your insertion, and get out. And if you can capture anyone who seems to know something about the inner workings of a Witch Gene, it will be greatly appreciated.\n\nWe have to warn you though, this world is far more dangerous than how it might seem at a first glance. Don't get too cocky because their Tier is lower than what you would usually consider a threat to your life. Ram (HALF of a Tier 5 Waifu) was able to fight Roswaal L. Mathers to a standstill, Emilia might be holding an Authority of her own while having the Apocalypse itself as her familiar, Reinhard seems to embody the concept of \"Unfairness\" and Subaru might become your worst nightmare if you fuck things up. That said, as long as you proceed with caution, this should be not more difficult than your regular mission.",

The people he tries to protect either fear or detest him because, despite his desire to be a good ruler, his own inexperience prevented him from being one. The single person that backs him is ineffective and does nothing to address the problem. And by the time he realized that instead of bringing his people peace and prosperity, he had only brought them suffering, it was too late, and he was sentenced to death.

We have managed to limit the damage but the problem is one that must be dealt with extreme prejudice before it escalates into an actual crisis. \nThe traitor is unfortunately very crafty, and while that is a trait that the company values very much in our contractors, it is currently acting to our detriment as said traitor is deceptively proficient in escaping danger. \nThe company has managed to quarantine the Traitor to a series of worlds ranging the Danger Ratings of 8 and 9, and have even disabled all his travel options. However, he proved himself annoying once again by deploying corrupted versions of the Elden Ring whose reality warping functions were rigged to caused multiple realities to collapse into each other, and form permanently open rifts between them through which anyone can freely travel. \n\nThe worlds you'll be sent to will most likely be undergoing one form of apocalyptic scenario or the other due to all the multiversal incursions, breaches and displacements whittling down the local society and economy, You must navigate delicate sociopolitical landscapes and explore dangerous war-zones to locate and retrieve the corrupted Elden Rings responsible for the local nexus. \nThe local factions will aid or hinder you depending on which world you are on and how you approach them, so some preparation before establishing contact is necessary. Especially so since they might have valuable intel on the threats you may encounter on said world. \n\nAfter all, it is nearly impossible to predict what entity will cross over next, and some especially dangerous threats may have already passed through undetected due to all the distortions on site making any attempt at a comprehensive scan unreliable.  \n\nThe Greater WIll, along with other such powerful multiversal Outer Gods are interested in the situation and are watching. \nAnd while the Greater Will in particular doesn't mind others taking its damaged toys, it will very much get annoyed if you make too much of a ruckus while doing so. It will most likely retaliate by deploying 'stars' the likes of Astel and the Elden Beast to deal with you and resolve the situation on its own. Retreat in case of such a scenario, as their attacks will be indiscriminate and any fight with them will ruin entire nations and worlds in the process, which is a severe loss of company resources. All entities sent at you in such a scenario will be Tier 9, or reality warpers at the very least. \n \nThe attacks may even extend to company managed locations, and while we can fight it back, it is a needless waste of resources, and no-one will thank you for causing it.\n\nMission Allotment\n\n- You will be allowed an extra use of 1000 credits SOLELY to spend on companions to help you deal with the situation. \n- You can also take as many defenses as you need before heading in.\n- You can also take all the pocket space upgrades up to demiplane for free. \n\nyou will be refunded the exact number of credits you spent while doing so.\n\nProceed with caution.",

I thought I needed someone who can do more than shoot magic bullets down the line, so I decided to give her a little power up. Saber Alter seemed fitting… I mean the aesthetics should fit with her darkness powers and all that. I thought that would be perfect.\n\nExcept it turns out the whole thing with Ex-Rumia wasn’t just a meme. Send help, she almost killed me when that damn ribbon came off. I think the power has driven her mad, but at least she hasn’t killed me. That said, she kinda chained me to the kitchen and is currently trying to burn down Gensokyo to stop anyone from stealing me, together with some other waifus of mine she has scared into submission. A few other girls got away and I think they may be trying to get help from the locals… I think she may have also affected some of them with the grail mud corruption from the Alter power-up...

But it is a twisted world, for its inhabitants are flawed in their perfection, hearts pure and innocent, yet that very thing makes them terrifying. Like children that may kill ants in amusement, they follow their instincts regardless of the consequences, even if doing so will be their own undoing. In this land, there rules a cold jaded tyrant queen that once upon a time was pure and hopeful. At her side stand her knights and army, trying to keep Fairy Britain functional in an endless struggle. For the very world considers the existence of this world a crime and continuously spills forth curses and evil to destroy it. Others rise up to challenge her reign, from would-be rebels over these that challenge her right to the throne. And a child of prophecy will rise to redeem the fae in the eyes of Gaia, even as that very act will surely erase the very world in which she lives in favor of a world that was denied long ago. Well, we say fuck all that shit. Your job is simple and straightforward. We will insert you some years before the canon events of Fate/Grand Order into Fairy Britain and then you must take over. Subjugate the Fairies, take over as ruler for Morgan and make the realm yours by taking out any competitors left around. It will be a struggle, as there are many other factions trying to gain power or undermine the current ruler already and you are unlikely to be more welcome than Morgan. Not to mention the capricious and innocently cruel nature of the fairies themselves. You will need to truly make them understand that you are in charge, in every way possible.",

But this is where you come in. For this mission, your job will be to carve out a functional successor state from the conquered lands. That is to say, you must create a new and at least equal Empire to the one ruled by Gaz himself. Such actions will naturally bring you into conflict with the six countries that united against the Gaz Empire, but such is life. Of course a proper claim on the Empire, it will likely be hard to get support from local powers. Fortunately, Emperor Gaz has left behind the perfect source of legitimacy, his wonderful ‘daughters’. Scattered throughout the lands of the former Gaz empire wander the Chaikas, each a ‘beloved daughter’ of his, searching for his remains. You must collect as many of them as possible and take them as your wives if you wish to make sure that your legitimacy in the eyes of the world is guaranteed.",

You may have heard of DNA², the famous series where an agent is sent back in time to make sure a boy allergic to women wouldn't grow in the Mega Playboy capable of seducing any woman by being there, only for her genetic alterations setting the change in motion and forcing her to find other ways. You may have also heard of Simgirls, the dating sim in that universe where the player character is the would-be Mega Playboy. One of our benefactors has, and found the game's Mega Playboy in need of a serious humiliation. And that is your job, to beat him at his own game by NTRing him of his entire Mega Playboy Ending harem. All six of them.\nJust a warning: to make it more \"satisfying\", the benefactor insisted on a few things, including the Mega Playboy to be at full power from the start - this version may not be able to seduce a woman by existing at her, but he's still quick at seducing almost every girl and a powerful (if unskilled) fighter, easily Tier 5 by fighting power alone.",
