    "additional": "Soul Gems: A meguca's soul is bilocated between her body and her soul gem such that she no longer falls unconscious if the two are separated by more than 100 meters and no longer dies if her soul gem is destroyed. Strictly speaking, the soul gem is only required for its functions as an item (e.g. transforming & detransforming, detecting magic, etc), and she may operate and use her powers without it in a pinch - but her soul gem is as much a part of her magical girl regalia as her magical girl uniform or signature weapon, and she may always recreate it or recall it to herself at will as long as she's alive to do so. Finally, a meguca won't transform into a witch if her soul gem darkens completely (though she is still 'out of' magic while it remains in such a state), and she no longer needs an object such as a grief seed in order to purge that darkness from her gem. This applies to captured witches as well.<p>Just as using magic and falling into despair causes her soul gem to dim, true hope and other deeply felt positive emotions on her part may restore her soul gem's shine. The magic pool in a meguca’s soul gem naturally recovers at a rate of one percent every minute, plus or minus the above effects of positive or negative emotions, respectively. If a gem darkens completely, its magic will not be usable, even if full, until the meguca deeply feels a positive emotion.</p><p>Amano Suzune:  If you have a Puella Magi in your retinue and have taken Salvation, Amano Suzune may (if present) copy their magic after their Doppel fades as if she had slain a Witch. Alternatively, if you have an Adjuster, the Adjuster may, through contact with Suzune's and another meguca's soul gems, overwrite Suzune's copied magic with the magic of the girl in question. (Adjusters themselves are ineligible as copy targets.) By default, any purchased Suzune Amano has her magic pre-set to Tsubaki's fire manipulation magic.</p><p>Other Characters: You may choose whether a purchased Kureha Yuna has her original personality or what she became after her hatred and despair caused her magical girl form to grow an oni horn.</p><p>If you have Isabeau and any binding method, her meguca contractees will be bound as if you had used the Stamp on them.</p><p>If for any reason a member of your retinue is incapable of being communicated with via telepathy, Sudachi's mumbling will instead be perfectly understandable to them.</p><p>You and all members of your retinue can see through Sana's passive invisibility, regardless of whether you have any magical abilities or not.</p><p>Mitama and Momoko can, at will, transform into their summer mermaid version in addition to their normal magical girl transformation, without any need for Mitama to alter their normal magical girl transformation. If you have Mitama, or Momoko and another Adjuster, she can grant any magical girl from the setting the same ability.</p><p>Once in your retinue, Himena will believe you to be her dead boyfriend and can't be convinced otherwise. If you are killed and Himena is still alive, your soul will be tethered to her body. You can communicate with her telepathically, share her senses, and authorize her to make purchases from the Catalog in your place. R.I.P rules will not activate unless Himena is killed while you are dead.</p>",

If a Contractor is split into Heartless and Nobody, both versions of the Contractor get a copy of their Company Device. However, they must re- complete before they will be allowed to leave the Kingdom Hearts universe. This includes entering their Pocket Apartment, Dragon Cabin, or other personal Demiplanes. Purchased copies of Kairi come with a copy of Heart of Light. Once purchased or captured, Naminé's memory abilities will work on anyone, not just Sora or those connected to him.",

Her original lower half, 'the Shadow,' has its own complete lower body and lives in an explicit pocket universe. Oblivion feeds a target to the Shadow like normal. Anima may also temporarily switch places with her Shadow; this tends to result in extreme collateral damage. Other: White Mage has her 8-Bit Theater characterization.

Each generic capture bounty (each combination of caste and essence rating) may only be claimed once. When building an Exalted character of Essence 2, just use normal Exalted character generation. For Essence 3, assume that the character has 150 experience income, in addition to the cost of the essence increase. For Essence 4, assume that the character has 400 experience income; Essence 5,750; and an additional 750 for each essence level after that.",
