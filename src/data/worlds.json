Strictly speaking, the soul gem is only required for its functions as an item (e.g. transforming & detransforming, detecting magic, etc), and she may operate and use her powers without it in a pinch - but her soul gem is as much a part of her magical girl regalia as her magical girl uniform or signature weapon, and she may always recreate it or recall it to herself at will as long as she's alive to do so. Finally, a meguca won't transform into a witch if her soul gem darkens completely (though she is still 'out of' magic while it remains in such a state), and she no longer needs an object such as a grief seed in order to purge that darkness from her gem. This applies to captured witches as well.<p>Just as using magic and falling into despair causes her soul gem to dim, true hope and other deeply felt positive emotions on her part may restore her soul gem's shine. The magic pool in a meguca’s soul gem naturally recovers at a rate of one percent every minute, plus or minus the above effects of positive or negative emotions, respectively. If a gem darkens completely, its magic will not be usable, even if full, until the meguca deeply feels a positive emotion.</p><p>Amano Suzune:  If you have a Puella Magi in your retinue and have taken Salvation, Amano Suzune may (if present) copy their magic after their Doppel fades as if she had slain a Witch. Alternatively, if you have an Adjuster, the Adjuster may, through contact with Suzune's and another meguca's soul gems, overwrite Suzune's copied magic with the magic of the girl in question. (Adjusters themselves are ineligible as copy targets.) By default, any purchased Suzune Amano has her magic pre-set to Tsubaki's fire manipulation magic.</p><p>Other Characters: You may choose whether a purchased Kureha Yuna has her original personality or what she became after her hatred and despair caused her magical girl form to grow an oni horn.</p><p>If you have Isabeau and any binding method, her meguca contractees will be bound as if you had used the Stamp on them.</p><p>If for any reason a member of your retinue is incapable of being communicated with via telepathy, Sudachi's mumbling will instead be perfectly understandable to them.</p><p>You and all members of your retinue can see through Sana's passive invisibility, regardless of whether you have any magical abilities or not.</p><p>Mitama and Momoko can, at will, transform into their summer mermaid version in addition to their normal magical girl transformation, without any need for Mitama to alter their normal magical girl transformation. If you have Mitama, or Momoko and another Adjuster, she can grant any magical girl from the setting the same ability.</p><p>Once in your retinue, Himena will believe you to be her dead boyfriend and can't be convinced otherwise. If you are killed and Himena is still alive, your soul will be tethered to her body. You can communicate with her telepathically, share her senses, and authorize her to make purchases from the Catalog in your place. R.I.P rules will not activate unless Himena is killed while you are dead.</p>",

For this reason, OC Donut Steel and Template Stacking will not work for parahuman powers when taken for yourself after chargen or a retinue member after the time of purchase.Psychic Talent applies to relevant parahuman powers, mostly (but not limited to) Thinker, Master, and Stranger abilities. Science and Engineering Talents apply to parahuman Tinker databases. Upon a parahuman’s capture, their shard will be forcibly shredded and integrated into their stamp tattoo, even if it’s dormant from the use of another binding or No Bindings. This process is much less violent with the Shroud, due to its use of existing spiritual or mental connections, but the shard still does not survive. A shard remnant tattoo has the same antimemetic properties as the original shard, which can be blocked by Mind Defense. Any other parahumans connected to the same shard will have their powers similarly reformatted, but are not considered captured by you unless you do so normally. Alt-powers: Due to the extreme prevalence of alt-power fanfics, the Taylors or other such characters of those AUs are available on request. If one of them is captured, their alt-power from that universe will be treated as a canon one; they will not manifest their actual canon power in addition.",

    "additional": "Rani VIII and the Extra version of Rin are both demi-Servants with Lu Bu and Cú Chulainn, respectively, as they were in Last Encore. If you already have Saint Kiara, the T10 Devil Kiara purchase may instead apply as a waifu perk, giving her the abilities of either her Devil or hypothetical Saver versions (one or the other) with no changes to her personality.    Command Seals    The following female characters count as valid Masters: Tohsaka Rin, Matou Rin, Dark Rin, Matou Sakura, Tohsaka Sakura, Dark Sakura, Beast Rin, Beast Sakura, mainline Illya, Luvia Edelfelt, Bazette, Caren, Kaleido Ruby, Kaleido Sapphire, Sola-Ui, Irisviel, Hakuno, Devil Kiara, Kohaku, Prisma Illya, Miyu, Angelica, Lancelot Sakura, Celenike, Fiore, Reika, Jean, Sakura Edelfelt, Prelati, Tiné, Tsubaki, Ayaka, Manaka, Reines, Yvette, Hishiri, Ritsuka, Yu, Ophelia, and Erice. Pseudo-Servants and Demi-Servants are Servants, not Masters.    Alternate Classes and Outfits    All Servants with Summer, Santa, or Halloween forms can use the associated skills and NPs at will. The same applies to Atalanta’s, Boudica’s, Da Vinci’s, Medusa’s, Nero’s, Nobunaga’s, and Mysterious Heroine X Alter’s alternate classes, except for Avenger Gorgon. When copying a Servant’s power through OC Donut Steel and Template Stacking II, alternate classes must still be purchased individually.    Alter Egos    BB has lost her connection to Nyarlathotep. Purchasing Amaterasu gives you all of the Tamamo Nine as well: Caster Tamamo, Tamamo Cat, Tamamo Vitch, and six others that have not yet appeared in canon. If you have already bought at least one of the Tamamo Nine at the time of purchasing Amaterasu, all credits that you paid for those nine will be refunded. If you instead capture Amaterasu, you will get any applicable refunds for purchased members of the Tamamo Nine and may purchase any missing ones for free. This is not automatic, in case you wish to capture the full set instead. (Treasured Beast Koyanskaya must be purchased or ascended separately.) Purchased or captured versions of any Tamamo will remain themselves as they grow more tails, not becoming Amaterasu even if they have a full set of nine. BB may instead spawn new copies of her Alter Egos if you do not already have them; any that she spawns will not count for capture or sale credits.    Servants    Captured Servants are no longer connected to the Throne of Heroes and will not affect their greater Heroic Spirits. All Servants exist in a quantum state where they are both fully incarnated and able to enter Spirit Form. Servants benefit from their homeland bonus in any version of their homeland, whether the past, their own time, the present, or the future. This does not include unrelated counterpart cultures and replaces the general background magical field rule. The body-modification suite is capable of changing Servants who have Golden Rule (Body), Divine Core of the Goddess, and other such skills.    Saber: Empyreal Eye overuse may cause Musashi to travel between worlds and eras on her own; if that happens and you have Rainbow Bridge, the portal room will connect to her new location as if it were intentional. She can learn to control this ability with practice. Artoria Alter has Cavall the 2nd as a familiar. Nero Claudius may access her Saber Venus form if you also have Altera. If you purchase Dioscuri, Castor or Pollux will be genderswapped so the two are identical twins once more, according to your orientation, or neither (or both) if you’re bi. Okita’s summer cyborgization cured her tuberculosis in canon; it remains cured here even if she only uses her Saber abilities.    Archer: The true love condition for Tomoe Gozen’s NP is transferred to you. Artemis has the mascot version of Orion as a familiar. Ishtar has Gugalanna Lily as a familiar.    Lancer: Artoria Lancer (not Alter) benefits from Goddess Rhongomyniad’s added power; the two will be treated as the same person. Purchased versions of Gareth have the memories of her fairy self from Lostbelt 6, in addition to her PHH version.    Rider: Sakamoto Ryouma has Oryou as a humanoid familiar; if you already have Oryou when you buy Ryouma, you’ll be refunded her full cost. Saint Martha has her dragon Tarrasque as a familiar. Nero Alter has Beast VI as a familiar. Habetrot will not be harmed by touching advanced technology, including her Black Barrel; purchased versions of her will have her memories from both Pan-Human History and Lostbelt 6.    Assassin: Hundred Faces Hassan’s main body is the adult female one. Carmilla’s Femme Fatale (False) does not affect her feelings toward you. Shuten Douji and Ibuki Douji are separate beings. Ibuki may be brought forth if you involve yourself in the events of Lostbelt 5.5, but the two oni are otherwise purchased and captured separately. Tamamo Vitch’s Independent Manifestation is limited to one local multiverse at a time.    Avenger: Space Ishtar (Ishtar Astoreth) can split off Astoreth and Space Ishtar/Rin into their own bodies, at will, and re-combine with them on contact.    Ruler: The Morgan le Fay of Pan-Human History has three distinct selves: her human aspect, Morgan, and her fairy aspect, Viviane, alongside her aspect as the inheritor of Britain’s mystics, Morgan le Fay. She can split off Morgan and Viviane into their own bodies, at will, and re-combine with them on contact.    Alter Ego: Kingprotea can control her size, all the way down to regular human height or the smallest you’ve been since the start of your journey, whichever is smaller.    Foreigner: Katsushika Oui has Tokitarou as a familiar; he’ll remain in the mental backseat while the two are fused."

Summons (non-humanoid): Non-humanoid summons, including Phoenix, Valefor, and Anima, can switch between their humanoid and original forms at will.

If you have a Glorious Shroud, you may reformat any of your Abyssal Exalts, including yourself, into Solars of the appropriate caste; the same applies in reverse to Solars if you have a Burial Shroud. If you have both Shrouds, your Solar and Abyssal Exalts may choose whether to be Solar or Abyssal at any time, but only one or the other. Even if you hit the 10-purchase Template Stacking I cap on multiple types of Exalts, each individual member of your retinue may only have one Exaltation at a time. This will generally be the one most suited to the individual in question, but you have the final say on who gets what. Generic Exalted DLC: Entries on this page are not actual characters and cannot be purchased. They are instead placeholders for capture targets or the Possess and Substitute origins. Each generic capture bounty (each combination of caste and essence rating) may only be claimed once. When building an Exalted character of Essence 2, just use normal Exalted character generation. For Essence 3, assume that the character has 150 experience income, in addition to the cost of the essence increase. For Essence 4, assume that the character has 400 experience income; Essence 5,750; and an additional 750 for each essence level after that."
