Further conditional modifiers are available for your waifus’ effective tier rating for the purpose of this lure’s compulsion. This “Aura Tier” (for clarity) does not affect the targets’ actual abilities and does not obey the standard tier cap. Characters with serpentine and feline traits get one point added to their Aura Tier; full serpents in humanoid form, actual cat kemonomimi and hybrids, and characters with draconic traits get two points; full dragons (that are sapient) instead get three. Waifus who share a theme with your draconic element get one.  Flaring your aura adds +1 to the Aura Tier of all waifus in the local universe for the duration, overriding the basic fear response. Exposure to any of your other lures will add one Aura Tier each to the affected targets for the following week (168 hours); additional exposure to the same lure, including expansions for that lure, will only reset this timer. These modifiers do not affect the waifus’ actual abilities and thus do not obey the standard tier cap.

You're supposed to take advantage of all of those. +3 from full dragons, +2 from Double and Elder Dragon, +1 from flaring the aura, and +1 for each distinct lure that the target is affected by (currently 8 official ones). That's a potential +14 in modifiers, ignoring other heritages' stuff 
Each additional aura tier is twice as vulnerable to the aura at the same range, so +14 is actually x2^14, or x16,384


TODO:

Picking General Seals should cause the Nasuverse Servant requirement in Command Seals to be crossed out
or you can check "I'm getting General Seals instead" in the Command Seals box

No binding discount applied after should go in debt

DLC's:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/17HrAj1iosBsuDgm_VInp8mvDCd4N1dHO_iLaDLLrz4c/edit (lot of expansion on working functionalities). Very expansive DLC. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j9emHb4IWvOTnp13RASTAuINAFuKDMSSQyQ-7ta9sjA/edit# Merior's stuff is bit smaller but also has some nice additions and would probably be faster to implement, especially if you filter out outdated perks. https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1iRs2MlrmcUoVDwCcKhAvDejtHwthDQelldYli6w1X2U/mobilebasic KatanaSoul's stuff is also relatively slim. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FM6PNbDEyZV4T4rVLWjPYBc3O0jmmwd1obkFD7jLDt8/edit#gid=1422010498 Celestial Dragon has some stuff as well... I feel like these four could be great start.
