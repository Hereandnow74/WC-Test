TODO:

Picking General Seals should cause the Nasuverse Servant requirement in Command Seals to be crossed out
or you can check "I'm getting General Seals instead" in the Command Seals box

DLC's:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/17HrAj1iosBsuDgm_VInp8mvDCd4N1dHO_iLaDLLrz4c/edit (lot of expansion on working functionalities). Very expansive DLC. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j9emHb4IWvOTnp13RASTAuINAFuKDMSSQyQ-7ta9sjA/edit# Merior's stuff is bit smaller but also has some nice additions and would probably be faster to implement, especially if you filter out outdated perks. https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1iRs2MlrmcUoVDwCcKhAvDejtHwthDQelldYli6w1X2U/mobilebasic KatanaSoul's stuff is also relatively slim. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FM6PNbDEyZV4T4rVLWjPYBc3O0jmmwd1obkFD7jLDt8/edit#gid=1422010498 Celestial Dragon has some stuff as well... I feel like these four could be great start.
